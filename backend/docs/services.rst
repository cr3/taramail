`Unbound`_ is a high-performance, open-source DNS resolver designed for
privacy, security, and speed. It resolves domain names into IP addresses,
and caches results for faster responses. Here's why it's used:

* **Privacy Protection**

  Ensures DNS queries are resolved securely without relying on
  external DNS providers, reducing exposure of sensitive metadata like
  email-related DNS lookups (e.g., MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC records).

* **DNSSEC Validation**

  Validates DNS responses using DNSSEC, ensuring the integrity and
  authenticity of DNS records, which is critical to preventing attacks
  like DNS spoofing or cache poisoning.

* **Performance Improvement**

  Caches DNS queries, significantly reducing response times for repeated
  lookups and optimizing the performance of services like spam filtering
  (which rely on frequent DNS lookups).

* **Integration with Mail Services**

  Email servers frequently query DNS to verify sender domains, validate
  email authenticity (e.g., SPF, DKIM, DMARC checks), and handle spam
  filtering (via RBLs). Unbound ensures these lookups are fast, reliable,
  and secure.

* **Resilience and Control**

  Ensures operations are independent of external DNS providers, increasing
  reliability and control in case of outages or misconfigurations with
  upstream DNS.

* **Enhanced Security for Anti-Spam**
